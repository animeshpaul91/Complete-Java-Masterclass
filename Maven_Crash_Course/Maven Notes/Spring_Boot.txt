Containerization: 
Containerization is the process of bringing together all the components that are required for an application to successfully operate along with the application itself. These containers can be easily ported and scaled across environments. Docker is the most popular containerization tool that follows the OCI (Open Container Initiative) Standard. This is all managed using a docker image. This image will have all the infrastructure for the application to operate along with the application itself. Containerization is based on the priciple of PODA (Package Once Deploy Anywhere). You can write your application to run in a single container (composed of web server, app server, db server and application itself) OR you may architect your application to be composed of microservices each running in it's own container.

Kubernetes is an Container Orchestration tool which is used for tasks like scaling up/down fleet of containers as well as fault tolerance.
