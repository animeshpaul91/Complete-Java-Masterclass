# Self Learnt Life Lessons
## This is a ledger of the wisdom that I have learnt in my life. This is a growing list

- Real Change happens slowly. Progress is gradual. Take tiny baby-steps towards your goals and iterate. Never try to rush with making progress.
- Good habits when done consistently compound over time. Create `systems` for yourself that power you to accomplish your goals.
- Comparison is the thief of Joy.
- Stop trusting social media. It is a silent killer. If possible, quit it.
- `Motivation` starts the fire. A `system` keeps it burning.
- Quality transcends Quantity. Try to almost `never` compromise with quality.
- It is better to have 2 trustworthy friends than having 20. Choose your company wisely. You become the person you hang out with.
