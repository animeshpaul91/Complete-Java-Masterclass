# Self-Learnt Life Lessons
## A growing ledger of wisdom from experiences, books, and conversations

- **Change is slow**: Progress is gradual; take tiny steps and iterate—rushing rarely lasts.
- **Habits compound**: Consistent good habits build momentum; design `systems` that make the right choice easy.
- **Comparison drains joy**: Measure yourself against your yesterday, not someone else's highlight reel.
- **Guard your inputs**: Social media can be a silent killer; limit or quit it when possible.
- **Motivation sparks, systems sustain**: Let `motivation` light the fire and your `system` keep it burning.
- **Quality over quantity**: Default to quality; cut corners only when it truly does not matter.
- **Choose your circle**: Two trustworthy friends beat twenty acquaintances; you become who you spend time with.
- **Hold your spine**: Say yes only when you mean it; people-pleasing and bootlicking kill respect.
- **Time is yours**: Employment is a contract for `servitude`; Every worker is an expendable asset. Value your time.
- **Own your life**: Never surrender your future to any entity that could replace you tomorrow.
