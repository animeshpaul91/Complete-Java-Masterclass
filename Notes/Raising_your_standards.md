### Raise your standards. First Principles
- **Find a haircut and style** that complements your head shape.
- **Shave regularly** (for men).
- **Wear clothes** that fit well and match your personal style/preferences.
- **Stay hydrated daily** — use a 40 oz+ insulated tumbler and sip a warm cup of green tea once the day. Helps with a glowing skin.
- **Maintain a consistent sleep schedule**, minimize disruptions, and prioritize sleep quality.
- **Exercise regularly** — combine strength training, weight lifting with cardio intense enough to raise your heart rate.
- **Follow a skincare routine** including cleansing and UV protection lotion.
- **Maintain a sensible diet** — cut junk food, alcohol, smoking/vaping; reduce sugars, greasy/fried foods; focus on eating right. Eat good food. Have a solid diet comprising all constituents of food.
- **Read Books** - Read books and think critically and dispassionately. Question everything.
- **Make good money** Make "good" money. Build real skills that are in demand to get to this goal. Money offers you with the freedom to do what you want with the time that you have. 
- **Practice kindness and confidence** — help others and yourself: give genuine compliments (even to yourself), define meaningful life goals; empathy and self-belief create a subtle but powerful “glow up".
- **Yoga and Meditation** - Practice pranayam and yoga.


### Build Authentic Masculinity
- Be soft spoken. Don’t talk a lot. Instead, let your actions speak. Actions always speak louder than words. Don’t be aggressive or pushy. Know what is right and wrong. 
- When pushed, only then be aggressive.
- Have deep respect for women. Have a chivalrous attitude to women.
- Real masculinity is about inner strength and confidence that radiates outwards. Have a sense of control of your nature.
