### Raise your standards. First Principles
- **Find a haircut and style** that complements your head shape.
- **Shave regularly** (for men).
- **Wear clothes** that fit well and match your personal style/preferences.
- **Stay hydrated daily** — use a 40 oz+ insulated tumbler and sip a warm cup of green tea once the day. Helps with a glowing skin.
- **Maintain a consistent sleep schedule**, minimize disruptions, and prioritize sleep quality.
- **Exercise regularly** — combine strength training, weight lifting with cardio intense enough to raise your heart rate.
- **Follow a skincare routine** including cleansing and UV protection lotion.
- **Maintain a sensible diet** — cut junk food, alcohol, smoking/vaping; reduce sugars, greasy/fried foods; focus on eating right. Eat good food. Have a solid diet comprising all constituents of food.
- **Read Books** - Read books and think critically and dispassionately. Question everything.
- **Make good money** - Make "good" money. Build real skills that are in demand to get to this goal. Money offers you with the freedom to do what you want with the time that you have. 
- **Practice kindness and confidence** — help others and yourself: give genuine compliments (even to yourself), define meaningful life goals; empathy and self-belief create a subtle but powerful “glow up".
- **Yoga and Meditation** - Practice pranayam and yoga.
- **Movies**: Watch a diverse array of movies. See things from the perspective of other's lenses.
- **Travel**: Travel the world. Widen your horizons. Learn about other countries and people.

### Build Authentic Masculinity
- Be soft spoken. Don’t talk a lot. Instead, let your actions speak. Actions always speak louder than words. Don’t be aggressive or pushy. Know what is right and wrong. 
- When pushed, only then be aggressive.
- Have deep respect for women. Have a chivalrous attitude to women.
- Real masculinity is about inner strength and confidence that radiates outwards. Have a sense of control of your nature.

1. Don't work with assholes. Toxic people will poison you.
2. Shortcuts are a scam. Take the long and hard road.
3. Stop worrying about what others think and get on with your life.
4. Don't craft a resume. Build a body of work. Nobody cares about curated credentials.
5. Raw talent is overrated; persistence is underrated. Keep at it and push forward.
6. Action beats planning. Just do it.
7. Cynicism isn't intelligence.
8. Move. Exercise.
9. Over time, you'll regret your inactions (what you didn't do).
10. No matter what you're working on, it will be governed by Hofstadter's Law (it always takes longer than you expect).

13. Luck is more important than you realise. The harder you work, the luckier you will get.
14. Stop waiting for permission. Give yourself permission.

16. Focus on what you can control. What you can't control is bigger than you think. What you can control is more important than you think.

18. Read more. 
19. Consistency beats intensity. Instead of working out `3 hours a day`, work out `30 mins every day`.
20. Treat everyone with respect. The world has hierarchies. Treat people at the top and the bottom with respect.
21. Mediocrity is the real threat. Failure is short-lived. Settling for the mundane can be a slow death.
22. It doesn't hurt to ask. In the worst case, you will get a `No`. You will get a `Yes` more than you suspect.
23. Curiosity beats certainty. Be less certain and more curious. When you think you are most certain, ask yourself: `Why might I be wrong?`
24. In the end, it's on you. To actually `accomplish` anything, you have to do most of the work yourself.
25. The most important choice you make is the people you surround yourself with. The people who become your spouse, friends, and co-workers will shape who you are. Choose them carefully.

27. Think positive-sum. The best way to win is to help others win.
