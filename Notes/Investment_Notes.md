## Stock Investment Criteria

Before investing in stocks, check these criteria:

### 1. Interest Coverage Ratio
**Formula:** Operating Income / Interest Expense
- **Goal:** > 6 ideally (The higher the better)
- **Source:** Summary tab on MorningStar

### 2. Debt to Assets Ratio
- **Goal:** < 0.75 ideally (The lower the better)
- **Source:** Financials -> Balance Sheet tab on MorningStar

### 3. Debt Payback Time
**Formula:** Long-Term Debt / Free Cash Flow
- **Find Long-Term Debt:** Financials -> Balance sheet and expand to search for "Total Long Term Debt"
- **Find Free Cash Flow:** Financials -> Cash Flow, see from summary (don't expand)
- **Example:** Apple = 0.99 (means 1 year to pay off all debt)
- **Goal:** Keep reasonably low

### If the company passes steps 1, 2 & 3 then:

### 4. Check EPS
**Earnings Per Share:** The higher the better
- **Source:** Financials -> Income Statement tab on MorningStar

### 5. ROIC (Return on Invested Capital)
**Most important profitability metric**
- **Goal:** > 10% (expressed as a percentage)
- **Source:** Operating Performance tab on MorningStar

### 6. PE Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio)
**Formula:** Stock Price / EPS
- **Goal:** < 15 (lower is better/cheaper)
- **Source:** "Valuation" tab or summary page "Price/Earnings" metric on MorningStar
- Compare with historical average and industry averages

## Index Fund Criteria

   - 3.2 Convert traditional IRA to Roth IRA.
4. Mega backdoor Roth IRA (After-tax 401k --> Roth IRA) using -

## How to Pick Stocks (4 things to look at):

1. **Economic Moat**
2. **Network Effect**
3. **Toll Bridge**
4. **Cost Mode**
5. **Profitability:** (100*Net_income / Invested Capital) [Anything in high teens or double digits is good]
6. **Price:** PE Ratio = current_stock_price / Earnings_per_share
   - Best buy price is when PE ratio is low. If PE ratio is high, then the company's stock is overpriced.
7. **Debt:** Debt_Payback = Long_term_debt / Free_Cashflow (Ideally <= 3 years is good)

## DERIVATIVES

### Options:
You have to get both the direction of the stock movement AND timing right.

## Questions for Fidelity:
1. Does my plan track source of Funds or source balances separately?
2. How long does in service rollover take? I'm planning to roll over to Roth IRA the same day the funds go inside in my after-tax 401k, without earning any gains on those contributions? I want to avoid doing a partial rollover.
3. Mega backdoor Roth - Process a rollover.
