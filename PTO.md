# 🧠 How Often Should a Software Engineer Take PTO?  
### *(Especially when your company has “unlimited” PTO)*

Burnout is real — and what you’re experiencing (fast pace, multiple features, infra work, CI/CD, little rest) is exactly what causes it. You’re doing the right thing by addressing this now.

Below is a clear, practical, engineering-friendly framework for PTO frequency that keeps you productive **without burning out**.

## ✅ 1. Macro PTO: **4–6 Weeks Per Year**

Even in companies with “unlimited PTO”, healthy engineering orgs (Google, Stripe, Meta, GitHub) typically see **4–6 weeks** per year as ideal.

### **Recommended structure:**

### ✔️ Option A — *Best for well-being*  
**1 week every quarter**  
(= 4 weeks/year)

### ✔️ Option B — *If planning quarterly PTO is hard*  
**2 weeks twice per year**  
(= 4 weeks/year)

### ✔️ Option C — *If you feel chronically burned out*  
**5–6 weeks per year**  
Your cognitive work benefits directly from more rest.

## ✅ 2. Micro PTO: **1–2 Long Weekends Per Month**

This is extremely good for mental health and very easy for managers to approve.

Examples:

- Take **Friday off** after a stressful sprint  
- Take **Monday off** after a release  
- Combine **WFH + a single PTO day** to decompress  

These small resets dramatically reduce chronic fatigue.

## ✅ 3. Immediate Reset Break (For Your Current Burnout)

Since you’re already exhausted:

### ✔️ Take **5 consecutive work days off**  
This pushes you out of burnout mode and resets your stress baseline.

Think of this as fixing debt before preventing more.

## ✅ 4. When to Take PTO

A simple rule:

### ✔️ Take PTO after completing major features or milestones.

Finishing a big feature → rest → start fresh.

This prevents the “push → push → crash” cycle.

## ✅ 5. How to Tell Your Manager (Copy/Paste Script)

Here’s a clean, professional message:

> **“To maintain long-term productivity and avoid burnout, I’d like to take PTO on a regular cadence — roughly one week every quarter plus an occasional long weekend. Does this work with our team’s plans?”**

Managers usually appreciate proactive communication.

---

## ✅ 6. Why This Matters

Burnout causes:

- worse focus  
- slower debugging  
- poorer design decisions  
- reduced creativity  
- higher frustration  
- more bugs  
- health issues  

Rest is *not* lost time — it’s part of being a high-performing engineer.

# 🧩 Your Personalized PTO Plan

Because you’re **currently burned out**, the best plan is:

### **Immediate:**  
- Take **5 days off** within the next 1–2 weeks.

### **Sustainable cadence:**  
- **1 week every 3–4 months**  
- **1 long weekend every 4–6 weeks**
